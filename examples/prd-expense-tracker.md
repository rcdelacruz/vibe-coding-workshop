# PRD: Personal Expense Tracker

## Introduction/Overview

A simple web application that helps users track their personal expenses and visualize spending patterns. The application solves the problem of poor financial awareness by providing an easy way to log expenses and see where money is being spent.

## Goals

1. Enable users to quickly log daily expenses
2. Categorize expenses for better organization
3. Provide visual summaries of spending patterns
4. Help users identify areas of overspending
5. Create a simple, fast interface for regular use

## User Stories

- Add new expenses with amount, category, and description
- View a list of my recent expenses
- See my spending totals by category
- Edit or delete incorrect expense entries
- Filter expenses by date range or category

**As a user reviewing my finances, I want to:**
- See visual charts of my spending by category
- Understand my monthly spending trends
- Identify my biggest expense categories
- Export my data for external analysis

## Design Considerations
