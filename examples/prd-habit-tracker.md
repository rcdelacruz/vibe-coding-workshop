# PRD: Personal Habit Tracker

## Introduction/Overview

A simple web application that helps users track their daily habits and visualize their progress over time. The application solves the problem of inconsistent habit formation by providing visual feedback and streak tracking to motivate users.

## Goals

1. Enable users to create and manage personal habits they want to track
2. Provide daily logging functionality for habit completion
3. Display visual progress through streaks and calendar views
4. Increase user motivation through progress visualization
5. Create a simple, distraction-free interface focused on habit tracking

## User Stories

**As a user wanting to build better habits, I want to:**
- Create new habits with custom names and descriptions
- Mark habits as complete or incomplete each day
- See my current streak for each habit
- View a calendar showing my habit completion history
- Edit or delete habits I no longer want to track

**As a user reviewing my progress, I want to:**
- See visual indicators of consistency (streaks, completion rates)
- Understand which habits I'm succeeding with and which need attention
- Feel motivated by seeing my progress over time

## Functional Requirements

1. **Habit Management**
   1.1. Users must be able to create new habits with a name and optional description
   1.2. Users must be able to edit habit names and descriptions
   1.3. Users must be able to delete habits
   1.4. Each habit must have a unique identifier

2. **Daily Tracking**
   2.1. Users must be able to mark habits as completed for the current day
   2.2. Users must be able to toggle habit completion status for the current day
   2.3. The system must prevent editing of past days (today only)
   2.4. Each habit completion must be timestamped

3. **Progress Visualization**
   3.1. The system must display current streak count for each habit
   3.2. The system must show a simple calendar view with completion indicators
   3.3. The system must calculate and display completion percentage for the last 30 days
   3.4. Visual indicators must clearly differentiate completed vs. incomplete days

4. **Data Persistence**
   4.1. All habit data must be stored locally in the browser
   4.2. Data must persist between browser sessions
   4.3. The system must handle data migration if storage format changes

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User accounts or authentication
- Social sharing or community features
- Habit reminders or notifications
- Advanced analytics or reporting
- Mobile app (web-only for now)
- Multi-device sync
- Habit categories or tags
- Goal setting beyond simple daily completion

## Design Considerations

- Clean, minimalist interface focusing on today's habits
- Use simple checkboxes or toggle buttons for completion
- Calendar view should be compact but readable
- Color coding: green for completed, gray for incomplete, neutral for future dates
- Responsive design for mobile web browsers
- Dark/light mode not required initially

## Technical Considerations

- Use localStorage for data persistence
- Implement using vanilla JavaScript or a simple framework (React/Vue)
- No backend or database required
- Consider using a date library for calendar calculations
- Ensure data structure allows for future enhancements

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully create and track at least 3 habits
- Users can see their progress clearly without confusion
- Application loads quickly and responds smoothly
- Data persists correctly between sessions
- Users report feeling motivated by the progress visualization

## Open Questions

- Should we limit the number of habits a user can create?
- How far back should the calendar view show? (30 days, 90 days?)
- Should we show any motivational messages or quotes?
- How should we handle timezone considerations for "today"?
