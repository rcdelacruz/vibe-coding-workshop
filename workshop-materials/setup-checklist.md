## Emergency Backup Plans

### Technical Issues
- [ ] **Demo fails**: Use pre-written examples, switch to participant's working setup
- [ ] **Network issues**: Focus on offline planning exercises, provide digital resources
- [ ] **Tool incompatibility**: Use copy-paste method for templates

### Time Issues
- [ ] **Running late**: Reduce hands-on time, focus on key concepts
- [ ] **Finishing early**: Add advanced topics, extended practice, peer mentoring

### Participant Issues
- [ ] **Struggling individuals**: Pair programming, simplified projects, process focus
- [ ] **Diverse skill levels**: Group fast/slow learners, use peer mentoring
- [ ] **Resistance to structure**: Show concrete benefits, address misconceptions
