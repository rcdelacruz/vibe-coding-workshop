# Instructor Notes: Vibe Coding Workshop

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Setup Checklist (30 minutes before)
- [ ] Test all demo projects in your chosen AI editor
- [ ] Prepare backup examples for different tech stacks
- [ ] Have troubleshooting solutions ready
- [ ] Set up timer for each module
- [ ] Prepare participant handouts

### Demo Environment
- Have a clean project folder ready
- Pre-load the template files
- Test that your AI editor can see and use the .mdc files
- Prepare a simple backup project (habit tracker works well)

---

## Module-by-Module Facilitation

### Module 1: Setup & Mindset (15 min)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Problem demo: 5 min (be dramatic, show real frustration)
- Solution overview: 5 min (stay high-level, don't get technical)
- Environment check: 5 min (walk around, help individuals)

**Common Issues:**
- Participants with different AI editors
- .mdc files not recognized
- Basic setup problems

**Solutions:**
- Have template content ready to copy-paste
- Know how to adapt for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf
- Pair up participants who are struggling

### Module 2: PRD Phase (30 min)

**Live Demo Tips:**
- Choose a simple, relatable project (habit tracker, expense tracker)
- Show real-time interaction with AI
- Demonstrate both good and bad responses to clarifying questions
- Don't rush - let participants see the thinking process

**Facilitation During Hands-On:**
- Walk around constantly
- Help participants who chose overly complex projects
- Encourage specific answers to AI questions
- Look for participants being too vague

**Red Flags to Address:**
- "I want to build Facebook" (too complex)
- One-word answers to AI questions
- Skipping the clarifying questions phase

### Module 3: Task Generation (25 min)

**Demo Strategy:**
- Use the same PRD from Module 2 for consistency
- Show the two-phase process clearly
- Emphasize the "Go" approval gate
- Point out task characteristics explicitly

**Watch For:**
- Participants who skip the high-level review
- Tasks that are still too large (30+ minutes)
- Missing infrastructure/setup tasks
- Tasks that don't match the PRD

### Module 4: Implementation (40 min)

**This is the critical module - spend time here:**

**Demo Approach:**
- Pick the very first task (usually HTML structure)
- Show the complete cycle: task → code → review → approval
- Demonstrate both "yes" and "fix this first" responses
- Keep it simple - don't get caught in complex debugging

**Hands-On Facilitation:**
- Set expectation: 2-3 tasks only
- Encourage testing at each step
- Help with technical issues quickly
- Remind about the approval gate process

**Common Challenges:**
- Participants rushing ahead
- Code that doesn't work (have simple fixes ready)
- Different tech stacks causing confusion
- Participants getting frustrated with AI

## Backup Plans

### If Demo Breaks
- Have pre-written examples ready
- Switch to a different project type
- Use participant's working example
- Fall back to explaining the process conceptually

### If Participants Struggle
- Pair programming with successful participants
- Simplify project scope dramatically
- Focus on the process over the outcome
- Use the habit tracker example as fallback

### If Time Runs Short
- Skip Module 5 group discussion
- Focus on getting everyone through 1 complete task
- Provide resources for self-guided completion

### If Time Runs Long
- Cut Module 4 hands-on time
- Reduce number of required completed tasks
- Combine reflection into final implementation time

## Key Teaching Moments

### Emphasize These Points:
1. **Structure enables creativity** (counter the "this limits me" objection)
2. **Small tasks prevent overwhelm** (show the psychological benefit)
3. **Approval gates maintain quality** (demonstrate the control aspect)
4. **AI works better with clarity** (show before/after examples)

### Address These Misconceptions:
- "This takes too long" → Show time saved vs. debugging later
- "AI should just know what I want" → Demonstrate context loss
- "I can just tell AI to build it" → Show quality degradation
- "This is too rigid" → Show flexibility within structure

---

## Measuring Success

### Individual Success Indicators:
- Participant has a complete PRD
- Task list makes logical sense
- At least 1-2 working code implementations
- Participant expresses confidence to continue

### Workshop Success Indicators:
- 80%+ participants complete a PRD
- 70%+ participants generate usable task lists
- 50%+ participants have working code
- Overall positive feedback on the process

### Follow-Up Opportunities:
- Collect contact info for check-ins
- Create Slack/Discord for ongoing support
- Plan advanced sessions
- Gather feedback for improvement

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Technical Issues
- **AI editor not working**: Have backup editor ready
- **Code doesn't run**: Focus on process over perfect code
- **Different tech stacks**: Adapt examples on the fly
- **Network issues**: Have offline examples ready

### Process Issues
- **Participant confusion**: Pair with successful participant
- **Resistance to structure**: Show concrete benefits
- **Falling behind**: Simplify scope dramatically
- **Getting ahead**: Redirect to help others

### Time Management
- **Running late**: Cut hands-on time, extend key concepts
- **Finishing early**: Add advanced topics or extended practice
- **Uneven progress**: Group fast/slow participants
