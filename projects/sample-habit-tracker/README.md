# Sample Habit Tracker - Vibe Coding Workshop Example

This is a working example of the **Habit Tracker** project used in the Vibe Coding Workshop. It demonstrates the complete implementation following the Vibe Coding methodology.

## About This Project

This habit tracker was built following the exact process taught in the workshop:
1. **PRD Creation** - Clear requirements definition
2. **Task Breakdown** - Structured implementation plan
3. **Step-by-Step Implementation** - One task at a time with approval gates

## Files Overview

### Core Application
- `index.html` - Main page structure and layout
- `styles.css` - Complete styling with responsive design
- `app.js` - Main application logic and UI management
- `habit-manager.js` - Business logic for habit operations
- `storage.js` - Data persistence using localStorage

### Documentation
- `tasks/prd-habit-tracker.md` - Original Product Requirements Document
- `tasks/tasks-prd-habit-tracker.md` - Generated task list with progress tracking
- `README.md` - This file

## Features Implemented

âœ… **Completed Tasks (from workshop demo):**
- [x] 1.1 Create index.html with basic structure and meta tags
- [x] 1.2 Create styles.css with reset and basic layout styles
- [x] 1.3 Create app.js with basic initialization
- [x] 1.4 Test that files load correctly in browser
- [x] 2.1 Create storage.js with localStorage wrapper functions
- [x] 2.2 Create habit-manager.js with CRUD operations

ðŸš§ **Remaining Tasks (for continued practice):**
- [ ] 2.3 Implement habit data structure and validation
- [ ] 2.4 Add unit tests for storage and habit management
- [ ] 3.1-3.4 Complete habit list interface
- [ ] 4.1-4.4 Implement daily tracking system
- [ ] 5.1-5.4 Build progress visualization
- [ ] 6.1-6.4 Polish and testing

## How to Use This Example

### For Workshop Participants
1. **Study the Process**: See how PRD â†’ Tasks â†’ Implementation works
2. **Continue Building**: Pick up where the workshop left off
3. **Practice the Method**: Use remaining tasks to practice approval gates

### For Self-Guided Learning
1. **Read the PRD**: Understand the requirements first
2. **Review Task List**: See how features break down into small tasks
3. **Follow Implementation**: Use the process-task-list.mdc template
4. **Build Your Own**: Create your own habit tracker variation

### For Instructors
1. **Demo Reference**: Use as live coding reference
2. **Backup Example**: Fall back to this if demos fail
3. **Show Progression**: Demonstrate task completion marking
4. **Quality Example**: Show what good task breakdown looks like

## Running the Application

1. **Simple Setup**: No build process required
2. **Open in Browser**: Double-click `index.html` or serve with simple HTTP server
3. **Start Using**: Add habits and track progress
4. **Data Persistence**: Your data saves automatically in browser storage

## Workshop Learning Points

This example demonstrates key Vibe Coding principles:

### âœ… **Clear Requirements**
- PRD defines exactly what to build
- User stories clarify the "why"
- Functional requirements specify the "what"
- Non-goals prevent scope creep

### âœ… **Structured Tasks**
- Tasks are small (15-30 minutes each)
- Each task has clear completion criteria
- Dependencies are logical and sequential
- Progress is visible and trackable

### âœ… **Quality Implementation**
- Code is readable and well-commented
- Error handling is included
- Responsive design works on mobile
- Data structure allows for future enhancements

## Next Steps

### Continue This Project
Use the remaining tasks to practice the Vibe Coding process:
```
Please start on task 2.3 and use @process-task-list.mdc
```

### Create Your Own
Apply the methodology to your own project:
1. Create a PRD for your idea
2. Generate tasks from the PRD
3. Implement step-by-step with approval gates

### Advanced Features
Once comfortable with the process, try adding:
- Habit categories and tags
- Advanced analytics and charts
- Data export/import functionality
- Habit reminders and notifications
- Social sharing features

## Troubleshooting

If the application doesn't work:
1. **Check Console**: Open browser developer tools for errors
2. **Verify Files**: Ensure all files are in the same directory
3. **Clear Storage**: Clear browser localStorage if data seems corrupted
4. **Simple Server**: Use `python -m http.server` or similar for local testing

**Remember**: This isn't about building the perfect habit trackerâ€”it's about learning the Vibe Coding process. Focus on the methodology, and the great applications will follow!
