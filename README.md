# Vibe Coding Workshop 🚀

*A structured approach to AI-assisted development*

## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** transforms chaotic AI interactions into a smooth, controlled development flow. Instead of endless back-and-forth with AI, you:

1. **Think First** - Create a clear Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. **Plan Structure** - Break down into manageable tasks
3. **Build with Flow** - Implement one task at a time with AI
4. **Maintain Control** - Approve each step before moving forward

**The Result**: Better code quality, less frustration, and a satisfying development rhythm.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Copy the Template Files
Download or copy the 3 files from `/templates/` to your project:
- `create-prd.mdc`
- `generate-tasks.mdc` 
- `process-task-list.mdc`

### 2. Create Your First PRD
In your AI editor (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code + Copilot, etc.):

```
Use @create-prd.mdc
I want to build: A simple personal expense tracker
This is a new project
```

### 3. Generate Tasks
Once you have your PRD:

```
Take @prd-expense-tracker.md and create tasks using @generate-tasks.mdc
```

### 4. Start Building
Begin implementation:

```
Please start on task 1.1 and use @process-task-list.mdc
```

**That's it!** You're now doing Vibe Coding.

## The 3-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Think (PRD Creation)
- Define WHAT you're building and WHY
- Answer AI's clarifying questions
- Get a clear, detailed requirements document
- **Time**: 10-15 minutes

### Step 2: Plan (Task Generation)
- Break the PRD into actionable tasks
- Review high-level structure
- Get detailed sub-tasks with clear completion criteria
- **Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Step 3: Build (Controlled Implementation)
- Work on ONE sub-task at a time
- Review AI's code before approving
- Say "yes" to continue or give feedback to improve
- **Time**: Varies by feature complexity

## Workshop Information

### For Participants
The **2-hour hands-on workshop** teaches you to:
- Create structured requirements before coding
- Generate actionable task lists from requirements
- Maintain control over AI implementation
- Build better code with less frustration

**What you'll leave with:**
- A completed PRD for your chosen project
- A detailed task list ready for implementation
- 2-3 working code implementations
- Confidence to continue independently

### For Instructors
Complete facilitation materials included:
- Step-by-step workshop guide with timing
- Instructor notes with troubleshooting tips
- Example projects and backup plans
- Success metrics and follow-up strategies

## AI Editor Compatibility

### ✅ Works Out of the Box
- **Cursor**: Full .mdc support
- **Windsurf**: May need conversion to .windsurfrules

### ⚙️ Requires Adaptation
- **VS Code + Extensions**: Remove YAML frontmatter, use as regular prompts
- **Other AI Editors**: Convert .mdc content to your editor's format

### 📝 Manual Process
For editors without file reference support:
1. Copy template content as prompts
2. Manually save generated PRDs and task lists
3. Follow the same approval gate process

## Why This Works

**Traditional AI Coding Problems:**
- ❌ Scope creep and feature drift
- ❌ Context loss in long conversations  
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality
- ❌ Feeling out of control
- ❌ Debugging mysterious issues

**Vibe Coding Solutions:**
- ✅ Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- ✅ One task at a time maintains focus
- ✅ Approval gates ensure quality
- ✅ You stay in control of the process
- ✅ Small tasks make debugging manageable

## Success Stories

*"I went from 3-hour debugging sessions to building features in 30-minute sprints."*

*"Finally, AI feels like a collaborative partner instead of a chaotic assistant."*

*"The PRD process helped me think through problems I didn't even know I had."*
